# Thermostat: business logic

[Back to the Challenge Map](README.md)

Alrighty. Now that you've got the basics under your fingers, it's time for a new domain.

In this challenge, you will build the logic needed to model a simple thermostat.

### Challenge setup



Specification:

- Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
- You can increase the temperature with an up function
- You can decrease the temperature with a down function
- The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
- If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
- If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
- Power saving mode is on by default
- You can reset the temperature to 20 with a reset function
- You can ask about the thermostat's current energy usage: < 18 is `low-usage`, < 25 is `medium-usage`, anything else is `high-usage`.
- (In the challenges where we add an interface, low-usage will be indicated with green, medium-usage indicated with black, high-usage indicated with red.)

| thermostat          |
| ------------------- |
| attributes:         |
| start_temperature   |
| power mode = 0n     |
| temperature         |
| (change it to off ) |
|                     |
| FUNCTIONS:          |
| up_temperature      |
| down_temperature    |
| powermode_on        |
| powermode_off       |
|                     |

INPUT

cons = MaxTempature
var

- on/off function for powermode
- How would we get a variable with the scope that we will be able to see it
-
- make a class attibute for power mode
- default on
- function to change it to off
